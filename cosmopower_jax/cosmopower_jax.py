class CosmoPowerJAX:
    """Predict cosmological power spectra using pre-trained neural networks.
    All done in JAX. Can predict the linear and non-linear (boost) power spectrum, 
    as well as CMB probes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    probe : string
        The probe being considered to make predictions. 
        Must be one of (the names are hopefully self-explanatory):
        'cmb_tt', 'cmb_ee', 'cmb_te', 'cmb_pp', 'mpk_lin', 'mpk_boost', 'mpk_nonlin', custom_log', 'custom_pca', 'custom'
    filename : string, default=None
        In case you want to restore from a custom file with the same pickle format
        as the provided ones, indicate the name to the .pkl file here.
        The .pkl file should be placed in the `cosmopower_jax/trained_models/` folder.
        You can specify either a .pkl file for a model trained on log-spectra ('custom_log','custom'),
        or for a model trained with PCAplusNN ('custom_pca').
        This is generally to upload models trained with the original CP, 
        so you will also probably need to pip install tensorflow.
        If you are using `TF>=2.14`, make sure you run the `convert_tf214.py` script first
        and follow the instructions there.
    filepath: string, default=None
        If you do not specify a filename, you can specify the full path where to upload the 
        pre-trained model from. Note that you cannot specify both `filename` and `filepath`, 
        and that if you specify `filepath` you need to ensure that the format is the correct one.
        CPJ will try its best to load it depending on the format and the specified `probe`.
    verbose: bool, default=True
        Whether you want important warning or information to be displayed, or not.
