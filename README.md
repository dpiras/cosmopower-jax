# CosmoPower-JAX-for-PFS

This is a fork of the original `cosmopower-jax` package. This fork serves as the input matter power spectrum for PFS cosmology forecast and future analyses that leverage differentiable forward models, e.g. for gradient-based sampling methods, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

`CosmoPower-JAX` in an extension of the [CosmoPower](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower) framework to emulate cosmological power spectra in a differentiable way. With `CosmoPower-JAX` you can efficiently run Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with hundreds of parameters (for example, nuisance parameters describing systematic effects), on CPUs and GPUs, in a fraction of the time which would be required with traditional methods. We provide some examples on how to use the neural emulators below, and more applications [in our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06347). You can also have a look at [our poster](https://github.com/dpiras/dpiras.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/poster_CPJ.pdf) presented at the [ML-IAP/CCA-2023](https://indico.iap.fr/event/1/overview) conference, which includes a video on how to use `CosmoPower-JAX`.

Of course, with `CosmoPower-JAX` you can also obtain efficient and differentiable predictions of cosmological power spectra. We show how to achieve this in less than 5 lines of code below.

## Installation

To install `CosmoPower-JAX`, you can simply use `pip`:

    pip install cosmopower-jax

We recommend doing it in a fresh `conda` environment, to avoid clashes (e.g. `conda create -n cpj python=3.9 && conda activate cpj`). 

Alternatively, you can:

    git clone https://github.com/dpiras/cosmopower-jax.git
    cd cosmopower-jax
    pip install . 

The latter will also give you access to a Jupyter notebook with some examples.

## Usage & example

After the installation, getting a cosmological power spectrum prediction is as simple as (e.g. for the CMB temperature power spectrum):

    import numpy as np
    from cosmopower_jax.cosmopower_jax import CosmoPowerJAX as CPJ
    # omega_b, omega_cdm, h, tau, n_s, ln10^10A_s
    cosmo_params = np.array([0.025, 0.11, 0.68, 0.1, 0.97, 3.1])
    emulator = CPJ(probe='cmb_tt')
    emulator_predictions = emulator.predict(cosmo_params)

Similarly, we can also compute derivatives like:

    emulator_derivatives = emulator.derivative(cosmo_params)

Rather than passing an array, as in the original `CosmoPower` syntax you can also pass a dictionary:

    cosmo_params = {'omega_b': [0.025],
                    'omega_cdm': [0.11],
                    'h': [0.68],
                    'tau_reio': [0.1],
                    'n_s': [0.97],
                    'ln10^{10}A_s': [3.1],
                    }
    emulator = CPJ(probe='cmb_tt')
    emulator_predictions = emulator.predict(cosmo_params)

We also support reusing original `CosmoPower` models, which you can now use in JAX without retraining. In that case, you should: 

```
   git clone https://github.com/dpiras/cosmopower-jax.git
   cd cosmopower-jax
```

and move your model(s) `.pkl` files into the folder `cosmopower_jax/trained_models`. At this point:

- if you can call your models from the `cosmopower-jax` folder you are in, you should be good to go;
- otherwise, run first `pip install .`, and then you should be able to call your custom models from anywhere.
 
To finally call a custom model, you can run:

```
from cosmopower_jax.cosmopower_jax import CosmoPowerJAX as CPJ
emulator_custom = CPJ(probe='custom_log', filename='<custom_filename>.pkl')
```

where `<custom_filename>.pkl` is the filename (only, no path) with your custom model, and `custom_log` indicates that your model was trained on log-spectra, so all predictions will be returned elevated to the power of 10. Alternatively, you can pass `custom_pca`, and you will automatically get the predictions for a model trained with `PCAplusNN`. In this case the parameter dictionary should of course contain the parameter keys corresponding to your trained model. We also allow the full `filepath` of the trained model to be indicated: in this case, do not specify `filename` and only indicate the full `filepath` including the suffix.

We provide a full walkthrough and all instructions in the accompanying [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dpiras/cosmopower-jax/blob/main/notebooks/emulators_example.ipynb), and we describe `CosmoPower-JAX` in detail in the release paper. We currently do not provide the code to train a neural-network model in JAX; if you would like to re-train a JAX-based neural network on different data, [raise an issue](https://github.com/dpiras/cosmopower-jax/issues) or contact [Davide Piras](mailto:davide.piras@unige.ch).

### Note if you are using `TensorFlow>=2.14`
If you are reusing a model trained with `CosmoPower` and have a `TensorFlow` version higher or equal to 2.14, you might get an error when trying to load the model, even in `CosmoPower-JAX`. This is [a known issue](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower/issues/22). In this case, you should run the `convert_tf214.py` script available in this repository to transform your `.pkl` file into a different format (based on `NumPy`) that will then be read by `CosmoPower-JAX`. You only have to do the conversion once for each `.pkl` file you have, make sure you `pip install .` after the conversion, and everything else should remain unchanged.
